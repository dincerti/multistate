```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

## Continuous versus Discrete Time

## Individual versus Cohort Models

## Modeling Assumptions
* Time homogeneous markov models 
    + Transition intensities are constant over time
- Time inhomogeneous (clock-forward) markov models
    + Transition intensity depends on time since entering into the initial state
- Semi-markov models (clock-reset)
    + Transition intensity depends on time in current state, but not time since 
    entering the initial state

## Slide with R
```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
summary(cars)
```

## Slide with Plot
```{r pressure}
plot(pressure)
```
