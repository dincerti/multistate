# Background

## Motivation
* Estimating social value is a common PHE task which requires:
    1. Estimating transition probabilities
    2. Using parametric models to extrapolate beyond available data
    3. Estimating time spent in each health state
    4. Quantifying uncertainty

* Multi-state models can do all of this in a parsimonious and generalizable manner

## What is a Multi-State Model?
* Model of how individuals move through multiple states in continuous time
* 3 types of states
    + initial state
    + intermediate state
    + absorbing state
* *Competing risk* models are special case with one initial state and several mutually exclusive absorbing states
* *Survival analysis* is a special case with one initial state (alive) and one absorbing state (dead)

## Canonical Example: The (Reversible) Illness-Death Model

\coordinate             (middle) at ($(healthy)!0.5!(sick)$);
\node[squarednode]      (dead)       [below=of middle] {Absorbing State \\(Dead)};

## Advantages for Parameter Estimation
* Properly accounts for competing risks
    + Individuals experiencing an event are no longer "at risk", which
    decreases transition intensities
* Flexible modeling of hazard rates
    + **Time homogeneous markov models**: transition intensities are constant over time
    + **Time inhomogeneous (clock-forward) markov models**: transition intensities depends on         time since entering the \underline{initial} state
    + **Semi-markov (clock-reset) models**: transition intensities depends on time since                entering the \underline{current} state

## Advantages for Health-Economic Modeling
* Model is in continuous time
    + Predicts exact length of time in states
    + Do not need to worry about multiple events occuring during intervals
* Model is at the individual level
    + Can account for treatment heterogeneity
    + Transition intensities can depend on prior history $\rightarrow$ fewer states than in         cohort models
    
# Estimation

## Software for Estimating Multi-State Models
* Nearly all of it is written in R
* Prominent R packages
    + *mstate*: non-parametric and semi-parametric models
    + *flexsurv*: parametric models
    + *msm*: missing information (e.g. do not know exact time of each transition)

## A Liver Cirrhosis Example
* To illustrate methods, lets consider a clinical trial where patients received "Placebo"" or "Prednisone"
* Reversible illness death model with 3 states
    + State 1: Normal
    + State 2: Low
    + State 3: Death
* 4 possible transitions
    + Normal to Low
    + Low to Normal
    + Low to Death
    + Normal to Death

## Examining the Data
* A patient treated with Prednisone

```{r setup, echo = FALSE, message=F, warning=F}
```

```{r create_data, echo = FALSE}
```

```{r show_data, echo = FALSE, comment=NA}
```

* Summarizing the transitions
```{r trans, comment=NA, echo=FALSE}
```

## Fitting Multi-State Models
* Joint model if constraints in parameters accross transitions; otherwise 
transition specific models are more computationally efficient
* Individuals entering "competing" states treated as censored
* Types of models
    * *Non-parametric*: fit separate Cox model to treatment and control
    * *Semi-parametric*: clock-forward or clock-reset Cox models
    * *Parametric*: standard survival distributions (e.g. Weibull, Gompertz)

```{r fit_cox, echo = FALSE}
```

```{r fit_weibull, echo = FALSE}
```

```{r fit_gompertz, echo = FALSE}
```

## Why do we Need Parametric Models?
* We have Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox models so why use parametric models?
* Some advantages of parametric approaches
    + Extrapolation beyond time periods in data
    + Prediction for new individuals
    + Less prone to overfitting
    + Faster simulations
    + Time dependent effects (e.g. non-proportional hazards)
* Estimates from flexible parametric models are very similar to non-parametric and semi-parametric alternatives
* Model checking is essential though!

## Some Model Checking
```{r cumhaz_cox, echo = FALSE}
```

```{r cumhaz_parametric, echo = FALSE}
```

```{r cumhaz_plot, echo = FALSE}
```

## Transition Probabilities in Multi-State Models
* A transition probability is the probability of being in state $X(T)=s$ at time $T$ given that an individual is in state $r$ at time $t_0$
\begin{align} \label{eqn:tp}
P_{rs}(t_0, T) = P(X(T)=s|X(t_0) = r)
\end{align}
* Given discount rate, $\beta(t)$, and quality of life weight, $q_s(t)$, discounted QALYs in state $s$ given given state $r$ at time $t_0$ are
\begin{align} \label{eqn:tp}
\int_{t_0}^{T} q_s(t) \beta(t) P_{rs}(t_0, t)dt
\end{align}
* Total QALYs are calculated by adding up QALYs in each non-absorbing state

## Estimating Transition Probabilities
* Illness-death model example:
    + Probability of transitioning from state 2 at time $t_0$ to state 3 at time $T$ is given by       multiplying:
        1. Probability of tansitioning to state 3 at some time before $T$
        2. Probability of staying in state 3 until time $T$
* General case for Markov models
    + Transition probabilities can be estimated by solving the *Kolmogorov forward equation*
    + Solution can be approximated by the *Aelen-Johansen estimator*
* Simulation needed for Semi-Markov Models
    + Aelen-Johansen estimator does not apply because transition probabilities from intermediate       states depend on when the state was entered

## Transition Probabilities in Clock-Forward Cox Models
Using R function `probtrans` from *mstate* package
```{r cf_cox_tp, echo = FALSE}
```

## Transition Probabilities in Clock-Reset Cox Models
Using R function `mssample` from *mstate* package
```{r cr_cox_tp, echo = FALSE, cache = T}
```

## Lifetime Simulation 
* Parametric models can be used to simulate outcomes beyond time in data 
* I've created function `simMS` for parametric Semi-Markov models
    + Time (and age) move forward as individuals jump from one event to the next
    + Simulates outcomes for a population of individuals with differing covariate values
    + Simulation stops when all individuals reach absorbing states or time has reached                   preset ending time
    + Can be used with any distribution by supplying a function to generate random numbers and         using the custom distribution framework in *flexsurv*
    + Allows analyst to specify different distributions for each transition
    + Only valid for semi-Markov models; use `probtrans` for clock-forward Markov models

## Benefits of Simulation
* Can calculate standard quantities of interest
    + Discounted QALYs (dQALYS)
    + Length of stay (LOS) in each state
    
\begin{center}
```{r cr_parametric_sim,results='asis', echo = FALSE, comment=NA, cache =T}
```    
\end{center}

* Don't need analytical expressions to estimate other more complicated quantities
* Assess uncertainty (e.g. probabilistic sensitivity analysis)
```{r psa, echo = FALSE, comment=NA, cache=T}
```
